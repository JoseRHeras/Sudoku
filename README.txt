As part of learning proedure this small project aims to put the things that 
I have learn so far to practice.

As an fan of sudoku games I loved solving them but saddly I'm not the best 
one at at. To confront this issue this project aims to help to help overcome
that feeling by providing a program that asides from providing sudoku games
it can also be used to solve exsiting ones.

The main goal is to help me familizare myself with the different technologies
that can be used and at the same time have fun.
